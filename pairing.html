  <h2>Pair with a seasoned Ruby developer!</h2>

  <p>I am currently offering pairing sessions on a sliding scale based on how effective I am
     at helping you. The best way to up your game is to pair with coders better than you. But
     even pairing with people your own skill level or lower is likely to teach you something
     as well.</p>

  <h2>Leverage my experience</h2>
  
  <p>Every opinion I have was hard earned. Each new practice I adopt is due to having lost
     a debate with someone who set me straight. I have gone through some brutal code post-
     mortems where my sloppy ruby code was not appreciated no accepted. I have had my tests
     ripped to shreds for testing the wrong thing, or testing outside the boundaries.</p>

  <p>Each and every day, I learn new aspects of software craftsmanship and details about ruby.
     I scour the interwebs in search for new knowledge. Then I practice what I find. Go ahead,
     leverage my nerd power. I spent the time to gather this knowledge, come feast with me!</p>
